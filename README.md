# PetTracker :dog: :mouse: :tiger:
PetTracker helps you build your pet collection and win pet battles by providing you with more information in a clean and concise manner.

It tracks your progress in each zone and displays the locations of all pets, stables and tamers on the map.
It exposes pet breeds and rarity everywhere. Unlike commonly done, breeds are given names and icons alike class specializations for easy identification.
It determines and displays all your enemies abilities as you fight and warns you of upgrades. Further, it shows the status of all pets in battle through an improved pet switching interface.
Finally, it provides a journal of all major PVE encounters and saves your history of fighting them, including loadouts used.

Now you are ready to catch them all.
